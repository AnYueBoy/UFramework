## About CatLib for Unity

CatLib for Unity is a service provider framework developed for Unity3D that is very helpful for the development of some functional businesses. We also reduce the unnecessary work of developers by integrating common development components.

## Getting Started

- [Download](https://github.com/CatLib/CatLib/releases/tag/v1.4.0) and extract the `unitypackage` to the unity project.
- Install the sample project under `CatLib/Example` and create a `GameObject` in the scene.
- Drag and drop the `Demo/Runtime/Main.cs` entry file onto `GameObject`.
- Run your unity scene and you will see the console output welcome string: `Hello CatLib`.
- Congratulations, the framework has been installed correctly, check out `CatLib/CHANGELOG.md` for change history.
